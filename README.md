# Competitive-Programming
CodeChef, is one of the educational initiative taken by Directi, an Indian software company to promote competitve programming among programmers to help them make it big in the world of algorithms and computer programming.
CodeChef is a productive and a very good platform to start your journey into the world of competitve programming.I started my journey by doing problems on this platform which indeed helped me brush up my basics as well as develop my skills.
Here, I have the solutions of the problems I have solved on CodeChef so far.
